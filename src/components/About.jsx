        <h2>A Legacy Woven Through Generations</h2>
        <p>
          For over 400 years, the art of Kente weaving has been passed down
          through generations of master weavers in Bonwire, Ghana. Each pattern
          holds deep cultural significance, telling stories of royalty,
          spirituality, and the indomitable African spirit
        </p>
        <p>
          At KenteHeritage, we work directly with artisan communities to bring
          you authentic pieces that honor this remarkable tradition while
          supporting the livelihoods of skilled craftsmen.
