# Heritage Kente E-commerce Web App (Frontend)

## Project Overview
Kente Shop Online is a frontend-only e-commerce web application built using JavaScript and the React framework, and styles using Tailwind CSS utility classes. The project simulates a complete online shopping experience for a traditional Kente shop, allowing users to browse products, add items to a cart, and complete a mock checkout flow.

This project was built to strengthen core frontend development skills, including dynamic UI rendering, state management using ContextAPI and Zustand, and multi-page application workflows.
